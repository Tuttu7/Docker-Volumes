#### Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure and OS of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker

#### To create volume
```
docker volume create ( volume name ) data_volume
```
#### Bind mount - mounts directory on any location on docker host
#### Volume mount - volume to it's directors
```
docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql

docker run -v /data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```

#### Bind mounting a directory in the docker host to the location in the container 

```
docker run -v /opt/data:/var/lib/mysql -d --name mysql-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=db_pass123 mysql
```
